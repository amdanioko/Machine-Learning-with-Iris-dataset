# Machine-Learning-with-Iris-dataset
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

Id
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm
Species

This data set contains the physical parameters of three flower species: Versicolor, Setosa, and Virginica. The dataset contains the numerical parameters Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width, and Petal length. Based on these parameters, we will predict the flower classes in this dataset. The data is made up of continuous numeric values that describe the dimensions of the various features. We will train the model using these features.
